In this project, we must manage .env files properly. These files store important data like API keys, and they are not saved in GitHub or commits for security. If the .env file is missing or deleted, the project might stop working locally.

However, the deployed site will keep working if .env variables are added to Cloudflare. Follow these steps to add .env variables in Cloudflare:
